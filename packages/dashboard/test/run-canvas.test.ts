// Seam: `toFlow`, what the Run view hands React Flow. An edge carries no action: it is drawn, not a Tab stop. React Flow makes
// every edge focusable unless told otherwise, and draws a focused edge like any other, so a keyboard user would pass through
// one invisible stop per edge before reaching the first node.
